# SCUT_HEAD_Dataset_Release
SCUT HEAD is a large-scale head detection dataset, including 3405 images labeld with 82727 heads.
# Description
SCUT HEAD is a large-scale head detection dataset, including 3405 images labeld with 82727 heads. The dataset consists of two parts. PartA includes 1000 images sampled from monitor videos of classrooms in an university with 38797 heads annotated. PartB includes 2405 images crawled from Internet with 43930 heads annotated. We have labelled every visable heads with xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax coordinates and ensured that annotations cover the entire head including the blocked parts but without extra background. Both PartA and PartB are divided into training and testing parts. Our dataset follows the standard of Pascal VOC. 

# PartA 
PartA includes 1000 images sampled from monitor videos of classrooms in an university with 38797 heads annotated. 700 images of PartA are for training and 300 for testing.
Because classrooms in an university usually looks similar and the poses of people vary less, we carefully choose representative images to gain variance and reduce similarity.

Representative images and annotations and the histogram of people counts are shown below.
